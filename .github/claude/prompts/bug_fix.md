## Bug-Specific Process

### Problem Analysis
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Analyze error logs and failing tests to understand the core issue
2. **Reproduce Issue**: Create minimal reproduction case if possible
3. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of the bug and affected functionality
4. **Review Recent Changes**: Identify what might have introduced the issue

### Debugging Process
1. **Log Analysis**: Carefully examine error messages, stack traces, and CI logs
2. **Code Review**: Examine suspicious code paths and recent changes
3. **Environment Check**: Verify configuration, dependencies, and environment setup
4. **Isolation**: Narrow down the specific conditions that trigger the failure

### Fix Implementation
1. **Targeted Fix**: Implement minimal change that resolves the issue
2. **Verify Solution**: Ensure the fix actually resolves the problem
3. **Regression Test**: Add tests to prevent this issue from recurring
4. **Documentation**: Document the fix and any preventive measures

### Common Bug Categories
- **Syntax Errors**: Typos, missing imports, incorrect syntax
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect algorithms, flawed business logic
- **Integration Issues**: API changes, dependency conflicts
- **Configuration Problems**: Environment variables, build settings
- **Test Failures**: Broken tests, outdated fixtures
- **Performance Issues**: Memory leaks, infinite loops, bottlenecks

- [ ] Root cause is identified and addressed
- [ ] Fix is minimal and targeted
- [ ] All tests pass (including new tests)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline succeeds
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed

Please analyze the failure, implement the fix, and provide a clear explanation of what was changed and why.
