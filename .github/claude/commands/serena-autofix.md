## Serena Auto-Fix Workflow

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Issue Detection
```bash
# Serena detects all types of issues
/serena-autofix full-workspace --issues=all --priority=medium
```
**Serena will:**
1. **Bug Detection**: Identify runtime errors, logic flaws, and incorrect implementations
2. **Test Failure Analysis**: Find failing tests and analyze root causes
3. **Quality Issues**: Detect code smells, formatting issues, and standard violations
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Scan for security flaws and vulnerabilities
5. **Performance Issues**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
6. **Dependency Issues**: Find version conflicts and dependency problems

### Phase 2: Intelligent Fix Planning
```bash
# Serena creates optimal fix strategy
/serena-autofix multi-project --issues=bugs,security --validate --document
```
**Serena will:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Deep analysis of issue causes and relationships
2. **Fix Strategy Development**: Plan optimal fix approaches and sequences
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential side effects and risks
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Understand cross-issue dependencies
5. **Validation Planning**: Define comprehensive validation strategies
6. **Rollback Preparation**: Prepare rollback plans for each fix

### Phase 3: Automated Fix Implementation
```bash
# Serena implements fixes safely and validates
/serena-autofix --issues=all --validate --rollback --document --parallel
```
**Serena will:**
1. **Incremental Fixes**: Apply fixes in safe, validated increments
2. **Parallel Processing**: Fix independent issues simultaneously where safe
3. **Continuous Validation**: Validate after each fix and rollback if needed
4. **Cross-Validation**: Ensure fixes don't create new issues
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance impact of fixes
6. **Documentation Generation**: Create comprehensive fix documentation
