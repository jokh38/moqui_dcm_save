- **Validate**: Ensure improvements don't break functionality or violate invariants
- **Document**: Update architecture documentation and decision logs

### Advanced Architecture Features
- **Invariant Enforcement**: Continuously validate architectural rules and constraints
- **Dependency Optimization**: Automatically optimize import structure and reduce coupling
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and apply design patterns where appropriate
- **Refactoring Automation**: Safe automated refactoring of complex structures
- **Technical Debt Management**: Identify, prioritize, and resolve technical debt
- **Architecture Compliance**: Ensure code follows established architectural principles
